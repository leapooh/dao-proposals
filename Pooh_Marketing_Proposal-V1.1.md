# Starting Marketing at Dextools + Dexscreener

## Overview:
This proposal aims to boost the growth of the POOH ecosystem through targeted advertising campaigns, utilizing the available funds of $50,000 to maximize visibility and engagement during the anticipated altcoin bullrun.

## Objective:
While social media posts on X (formerly known as Twitter) have fostered community engagement, they alone are insufficient for a significant uplift in market capitalization (MC). The objective is to drive upward momentum by directly reaching potential investors and traders through strategic advertising on specialized crypto platforms.

## Proposal Details

### Advertising Platforms:

#### **Dextools:**
- **Package:** Premium, approximately 1M views.
- **Duration:** Based on achieving approximately 1M views or impressions.
- **Cost:** $7,000.
- **Note:** The selected package will be tailored according to the allocated budget of $7,000.

#### **Dexscreener:**
- **Package:** Exclusive Trending Bar.
- **Duration:** Based on achieving approximately 800K views or impressions.
- **Cost:** $7,000.

### Budget Allocation:
- **Total Initial Campaign Budget:** $14,000 (28% of the total $50,000 POOH funds).
  - Dextools: $7,000 (50% of the advertising budget).
  - Dexscreener: $7,000 (50% of the advertising budget).

### Wallet Address for Fund Allocation:
- **Wallet:** (PENDING).
- Funds allocated for the advertising budget will be sent in ETH to this wallet, which will handle payments for both Dextools and Dexscreener campaigns.
  - **Note:** All transactions will be trackable on the Ethereum blockchain to ensure transparency.

### General Disclaimer:
- If the Dextools package cannot be purchased or if there are complications in the process, the next steps will depend on the performance of the Dexscreener advertising campaign:
  - If results (engagement, transaction volume) are positive, a second package on Dexscreener will be purchased.
  - If results are insufficient, the allocated funds (minus Ethereum gas fees) will be returned to the original wallet.
- If neither the Dextools nor the Dexscreener packages can be purchased, the entire $14,000 allocated for the campaign (minus Ethereum gas fees) will be returned to the original wallet.

### Campaign Goals:
- **Visibility:** Increase the recognition of $POOH among potential investors and traders.
- **Engagement:** Drive new wallet creations and boost trading volume.
- **Market Position:** Strengthen $POOH's presence in the altcoin market during the expected bullrun.

### Furniture for Advertising:
- **Dextools Advertising Panel:** Prominently displayed on the main dashboard, seen by users analyzing tokens.
- **Dexscreener Banner Placement:** A banner in the trending tokens section to catch the attention of active traders.

### Duration of Campaign:
- The initial advertising campaign will run until the desired impressions or views are achieved, with the potential for extension or adjustment based on performance.

## Expected Outcomes:
- Enhanced awareness of $POOH, potentially leading to a surge in interest and investment.
- Increased liquidity and trading volume due to broader exposure.
- A solid foundation for further marketing initiatives if this campaign proves successful.

## Risks and Contingency:
- **Volatility:** Crypto markets are volatile; the bullrun might be delayed or less pronounced than expected.
- **Platform Dependency:** Heavy reliance on Dextools and Dexscreener; any technical issue or policy change could affect campaign outcomes.

### Monitoring and Adjustment:
- Continuous monitoring of campaign performance through views, clicks, and trading volume.

## Summary:
This proposal allocates $14,000 from the $50,000 total funds for a strategic marketing effort on Dextools and Dexscreener. The campaign is designed to significantly increase visibility, trader engagement, and market strength for $POOH, leveraging the platforms where potential investors are actively looking for investment opportunities. This initial investment represents 28% of the available funds, aiming to kickstart growth with the possibility of scaling marketing efforts based on the campaign's success.
